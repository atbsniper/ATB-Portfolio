## Overview

I've successfully integrated your WordPress blog with your main website theme. The blog is now accessible at `/blog` and features a custom cyberpunk theme that matches your portfolio website's design.

## What Was Created

  - Animated elements with AOS
  - Tailwind CSS integration

### 2. Theme Files Created

### 3. Navigation Updates
Updated all your main website pages to include a "BLOG" link in the navigation:
